<p>
  I recently wrapped up a term as a <strong>Machineâ€¯Learningâ€¯Robotics Intern at Boston Dynamicsâ€¯AIâ€¯Institute</strong>,
  where I built a constraintâ€‘aware procedural sceneâ€‘generation engine used across navigation, manipulation, and embodiedâ€‘vision teams.
</p>

<p>
  Before that, I was an <strong>Artificial Intelligence Researcher Intern</strong> in Waterlooâ€™s CViSS Lab
  (synthetic 3D pointâ€‘cloud &amp; mesh generation, robust segmentation models),
  a <strong>Machine Learning Developer Intern at IBM</strong>
  (realâ€‘time acoustic localization and model pruning algorithm), and a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer Intern at PerkinElmer</strong>
  (end-to-end computer vision pipeline).
</p>

<p>
  I thrive on fast paced teams working on hard problems, tight feedback loops, and shipping ML systems that works in the real world.
