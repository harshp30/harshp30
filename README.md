### Hi there, I'm Harsh ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Computer Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo student. I am interested in creating software and hardware systems. 

My passion from STEM originates from time at FIRST robotics, completion of CS50, completion of a Web Development Bootcamp, and my tendency to be curious. My curiosity eventually led me to building projects that are fun and unique! 

I have months of experience in Python, Java, C++, and Processing 

Some of my projects that you can find on here include: 

- Autonomous RC Car
- Basketball Mini hoop that keeps track of a user's makes and misses 
- PC LED system  
- Hand gestured RC Car 
- A Clap (sound) controlled lamp 
- Software that can detect whether the user is wearing a mask or not 

Currently I am interning at Xerris Inc as a Front-End developer and am re-reviewing the core concepts from CS50ai in order get some machine learning projects up.

Outside of coding,  

I spend time playing or watching sports 
I spend my time giving back to the community by tutoring middle school students 
I also run workshops teaching Java and machine learning concepts
