<h3 align="center">I am currently seeking a Winter 2025 Internship</h3>
<h3 align="center">I am also a Computer Engineering student at the <ins>University of Waterloo</ins></h3>
<h1></h1>

<p>I recently completed my role as an <strong>Artificial Intelligence Researcher Intern</strong> at the CViSS Lab at the University of Waterloo, where I developed frameworks for generating synthetic 3D point cloud and mesh scenes, and created custom semantic segmentation models for 3D environments. My professional journey includes valuable experiences as a <strong>Machine Learning Developer Intern at IBM</strong> and a <strong>Machine Learning Engineer Intern at PerkinElmer, Inc.</strong>, where I've contributed to diverse projects ranging from computer vision applications to deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
            
<p>I'm always eager to take on new challenges and dive into innovative projects. My journey in tech is driven by a constant desire to learn and grow. I'm excited to continue expanding my skills through internships and personal projects, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI and machine learning. Curious about what I've been working on? Check out some of my work below!</p>
