### Hi there, I'm Harsh ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Computer Engineering student @ the University of Waterloo student. I am interested in creating software and hardware systems. 

My passion from STEM originates from time at FIRST robotics, completion of CS50, completion of a Web Development Bootcamp, and my tendency to be curious. My curiosity eventually led me to building projects that are fun and unique! 

I have months of experience in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C++, and Processing 

Some of my projects that you can find on here include: 

- Heart Disease Classification Model
- California Housing Regression Model
- Dog Breed Identification Model
- Autonomous RC Car
- Basketball Mini hoop that keeps track of a user's makes and misses 
- PC LED system  
- Hand gestured RC Car 

Currently I am interning at Friendlier as a FSoftware Engineer and am building projects on the side.

Outside of work,  

I spend time playing or watching sports 
I spend time learning new skills
I am proactive in my learning
